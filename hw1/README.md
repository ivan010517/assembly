# Programming Problem I

Write an ARM assembly code to implement a reverse program which can print out the input string in reverse order to the screen. In addition, the English letters in the string have to be converted to lowercase. For example, when you execute reverse program as follows:  
```
arm-none-eabi-run reverse "It is Tom's apple."  
```
Then the screen should show the following results:  
```
reversed result: .elppa s'mot si ti  
```
